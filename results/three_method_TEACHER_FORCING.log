💡 INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Expected patterns:
  • I-frame: HIGH static mAP, LOW moving mAP (assumes no motion)
  • MV Model: HIGH moving mAP, GOOD static mAP (tracks motion)
  • Mean-VC: MEDIUM both (interpolates between)


Key Insights:
  1. I-frame fails on moving objects → motion tracking is essential
  2. MV model improves moving object detection significantly
  3. MV model maintains good performance on static objects
