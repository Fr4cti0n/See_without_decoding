================================================================================
💡 JUSTIFICATION
================================================================================

Static objects may show 'false motion' due to:
  • Illumination changes across frames
  • Video compression/reconstruction artifacts
  • Minor camera vibration or lens effects

By filtering to ONLY moving objects, we evaluate the MV model's
true advantage: tracking objects that actually change position.
The I-frame baseline assumes objects don't move, so it should
fail on moving objects while succeeding on truly static ones.
